# PostOffice automated app

Presently the tracking of postal packages is a tedious task. For example if we want to track a postal package especially in government agencies the employers need to fill the information manually on an online portal and it takes time to do so for so many packages.Then we receive a pin and we can track the package. But this app helps to save the time and the task is also automated.

This app takes in the name, mobile number of the sender as well as the pincode. When the package reaches a post-office the employee takes the picture of these three things and the script runs from behind and after the segmentation characters enter in the desired fields of the app. The location of the postoffice is also taken as the input. The app tells us the location of the parcel through a SMS on the mobile number written on the package.
